            Protein is the main thing you need to start eating in order to build muscle in the gym.
            Protein builds muscle by providing the necessary amino acids to repair and grow muscle fibers
            after they are broken down during exercise. Intense workouts cause micro-tears in muscle
            fibers, and the body uses dietary protein to repair this damage. General rule of thumb is you
            should be eating about 70–80% of your body weight in protein.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although protein is important you also want to watch fat and carbs. Carbs are very good
            before a workout as that is what helps fuel your workouts. You should never consume a high
            fat meal before a workout as this will slow you down. You want to try to intake as little
            fat as possible, however, some fats are good for you with many nutrients like eggs and
            avocados.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to losing weight you want to make sure the total calorie consumed is less
            than your total calories burned. There are many helpful apps that will tell you how many
            calories you need to stay the same weight so just make sure you are eating less than that.
            Same goes for if you’re trying to gain weight to help build muscle.
