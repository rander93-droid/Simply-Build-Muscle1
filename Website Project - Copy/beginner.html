          When starting out the first thing to understand is that in order to build muscle you have to 
          train your muscles close to failure, which means going until you can’t do another good, clean 
          repetition. No matter what exercise you are doing, this is what you should be aiming for to 
          achieve the most growth. The second most important thing is consistency. Consistency is the key 
          to seeing long-term progress, but also don’t overwork yourself. You should be working out about 
          4–6 times a week to ensure you still get plenty of rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest is where you are able to let your muscles recover so you can actually see improvements. 
          While working out, you have your sets and then your reps. Reps are the amount of times you do a 
          certain weight before failing. Once you fail, all of those reps are what’s called a set. This is 
          helpful for knowing how much of something you should do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important note is that this applies to any amount of weight. You should not care what 
          other people are lifting because you are not them. Comparison is the thief of joy, so be proud 
          of what you are doing and celebrate every time you lift more than you did before.

        <p>
          Many people follow different workout plans depending on what they like. The plan you follow does 
          not matter as long as you are training everything equally and you find it fun to do. Here is a 
          list of a couple popular ones you can try. Keep in mind none of these list cardio, as cardio is 
          something you should do at the end of every workout.

        <p class="beginner-bottom-text">
          In order to build bigger muscles you want to do 2–3 exercises for each muscle group, consisting 
          of about 2–3 sets of each exercise and about 6–8 reps in each set. If you would like to get 
          stronger, do about 3–5 reps in each set. Whenever you start to go over the 8-rep range, add more 
          weight for next time so that you’re able to do around 6 solid reps.
